## Favicon

This project prefers a proper ICO at `/favicon.ico`. To generate one from the existing `src/assets/leaf.png` you'll find a helper script in `scripts/generate-favicon.ps1`.

Usage (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd ApothecaryShopUI/scripts; ./generate-favicon.ps1
```

The script uses ImageMagick (`magick convert`) to create a multi-size `favicon.ico` placed in the UI root. Install ImageMagick and ensure `magick` is in your PATH before running.
